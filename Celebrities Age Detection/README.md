## Age Detection of Celebrities

- Problem Statement:

Develop an age prediction model using a dataset of facial images to accurately estimate the age of an individual based on the facial features. The goal is to create a reliable and robust system that can predict the age of a person within a certain range (e.g., Young, Middle, and Old) by analysing their facial characteristics. The model should be able to handle variations in lighting conditions, facial expressions, and other factors that may affect age estimation accuracy. The solution should leverage techniques from machine learning and/or computer vision to extract relevant features from facial images and to train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating the age of individuals from arriving images that were not present in the dataset.
