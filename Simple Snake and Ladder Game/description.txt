In this program, the snake_ladder dictionary defines the positions of the snakes and ladders on the board. The player_positions 
list keeps track of each player's current position on the board. The roll_die function generates a random number between 1 and 6 
to simulate the rolling of a die. The move_player function updates a player's position based on the number of spaces they move 
and any snake or ladder they encounter.

The game loop repeatedly prompts the current player to roll the die, moves the player, checks for a win condition, and switches to
the next player. The loop continues until a player reaches or exceeds position 100, at which point the game is over and the 
winning player is declared.
